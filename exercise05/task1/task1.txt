What is the range of possible priorities defined by POSIX?

It differs in each system. The minimum priority range required by the POSIX standard is
from 0 to 31. 
POSIX.1 range 0 to 31
Linux: ran 0 to 32768-1

Are you limited to this range on your system?
On the ZID it is 32768-1 (sysconf(_SC_MQ_PRIO_MAX) - 1)

What is more important a task with priority 2 or 99 (gets scheduled first)?
The order is from 0 (low) to 31 or _SC_MQ_PRIO_MAX (high). So 99 gets scheduled first!
