Execution times:
    mutex:      User time (seconds) 0.83
                System time (seconds) 0.90

    atomics:    User time (seconds) 2.12
                System time (seconds) 0.10


What is the effect of specifying optimization flags when compiling?
    These flags tell the compiler to improve the performance and the code size but the compile time will be longer.

How do -O2 and -O3 differ?
    -02: GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
    -O3:  -O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2 and some more.

What is the difference between using += on a normal vs. an atomic integer type?
    += is a race condition with normal integers but not on atomic integers. 

How does using e.g. += on atomic types relate to using atomic functions such as atomic_fetch_add?
    They are the same both are guaranteed to be atomic

Which operations other than decrementing/incrementing can be done atomically?
    All read-modify-write operators (e.g. ++ or *=) on these are guaranteed to be atomic.
