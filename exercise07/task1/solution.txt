Task1:
--------------------------------

syscall: openat(AT_FDCWD, "./hint.txt", O_RDWR)  = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
That call leads to creating a new file called "hint.txt"

openat(AT_FDCWD, "./key.txt", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
That call leads to creating a new file called "key.txt"

Then the key is revealed in the hint.txt file.

The secret that should be provided in the solution is in my case: f530d850
